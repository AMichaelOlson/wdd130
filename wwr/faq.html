        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Where do the tours take place?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
            <p>The tours are available for scheduling on four different rivers! Those rivers are:
                The Grand Canyon's Colorado River; The Salmon River; The Rogue River; and The Klamath River. 
                Depending on your experience level, and your location, at least one tour on one of these rivers will 
                be perfect for you guaranteed! 
            </p></div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long do the tours last?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p> We offer multiple options based on your comfort level. Tours start at a minimum of 3 hours, 
                    and are offered up to an overnight float. Every tour is of course led by one of our professional
                    guides, and depending on local weather the estimated time is subject to change. Overall,
                    how long you want to enjoy the water is up to you!

            <h3>What are the dangers of rafting?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                    Our tour guides are expereinced professionals who are very aware of the rivers they will guide you down.
                     Many accidents can be 
                    avoided by heeding their advice. The main danger of White-water Rafting is the possibility of falling
                    out of the raft. Being in the water during rapids is very dangerous even for experienced swimmers.
                    As a precaution, you must wear a life jacket, and again we stress the importance of listening to the 
                    guidance of your tour guide. As long as you keep the jacket on, and listen to what they say, there should
                    be no danger, and tons of fun!

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>When is the best time to schedule rafting for?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The best time is whenever youre available! However we dont offer tours during the winter months due to cold.
                    Late May to Early June is probably the most opportune time to get out in the water due to spring runoffs
                    making rivers a little more full, less crowds, and an overall nice water temperature. Of course there is simply
                    no alternative to beating that summer month heat like going rafting on the water. What are you waiting for? Let's
                    schedule you a time to have the time of your life!
