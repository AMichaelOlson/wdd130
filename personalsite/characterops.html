        Character Options
    </h1>
    <p>
        Below will be the list of 8 of the base Character options provided in the D&D Players Handbook. This site will be 
        highlighting only the non-human choices, since playing a human doesnt really add anything most of us shouldnt be familiar with.
        Alongside each of the options is an image that is meant to give you an idea of how they might look, but it isn't
        a concrete visual representation. In D&D, every options is provided the same core stat increase rules, so the largest difference
        between each of them will be features, and other stats such as speed or size.

                 Elves are, by nature, more dextrous and wise than most other humanoids and their physical features are
                almost unearthly. Elves live for more than 700 years, and often this leads to a more big picture perspective that is 
                contrary to what many others with shorter life-spans think. Elves can often seem haughty to others due to that perspective
                as well. Elves are associated with the Fey, a mystical realm of beauty and danger, and because of this they have some key features.
                Elves have Darkvision, and the unique ability to withstand magical sleep, and the need to meditate for 4 hours rather than
                sleep at night. There are three main types of Elves, the Wood Elf, a reclusive and nature focused denizen of the deep forest,
                the High Elf, Elves that typically focus on cultivating magic within themselves, and finally the Dark Elf or Drow, Elves 
                that were centuries ago forced underground and are associated with the more sketchy side of life.

                 Dwarves are a proud and stubborn race of short Humanoids. They are extremely loyal to allies,
                while at the same time being moderately distrusting of strangers. As a general rule, Dwarves are less than civil to
                most elves they meet however, there are exceptions. Dwarves can live to be just over 400 years old, and their memory
                serves them well to the end. Dwarves have Darkvision, meaning they can see in dark light as though it were dim, but only 
                in shades of grey. Dwarves are also resistant to poisons, and gain proficiencies with hammers and axes. There are two main
                types of Dwarf to choose from, the first is a Hill dwarf which is a typically wiser, and more hardy dwarf, and the second 
                is a Mountain dwarf, accustomed to rough conditions and much stronger than the Hill dwarves are.

                 <h1>The Scaled Dragonborn</h1>

                 Dragonborn are not technically dragons, they are more closely related to lizards. They lack the wings and 
                tail that they seemingly should have, but do retain the scaly skin and the ability to breath elements. Dragonborn typically
                come from clans, based on a particular ancestry of Dragon. Different draconic ancestry leads to slight variations among 
                the Dragonborn as a people. Dragonborn are considered a more uncommon race of humanoid and some have never seen them before
                in more rural parts of certain lands. Dragonborn have the breath weapon attack, and resistances of whatever draconic ancestry
                they share. A blue dragonborn has an electric breath weapon, while a red dragonborn can breathe fire. Work with your DM
                about what ancestry your Dragonborn comes from and what that means for your character.

                 Gnomes are small folk like the Halflings are, but what they lack in size they more than make up for in
                pure intelligence and dexterity. Gnomes are naturally gifted creators, and are often tinkering with mechanical devices. Gnomes can live
                up to 500 years, and despite that they live each day as if it is their only chance to do what life has to offer. There are two
                types of Gnomes. The first is a Forest Gnome, as the name suggests, these are Gnomes that reside in forests, Gnomes who live there
                have a natural knack for illusion magic and natural stealth and speed. These Gnomes also have the innate ability to convey simple
                ideas and thoughts to small beasts and critters such as squirrels or small birds. The other Gnomes tend to live outside of the forest,
                whether underground or just within the settlements of other species. These Gnomes are called Rock Gnomes, and they make up the 
                majority of the Gnome population. Rock Gnomes are the inventors and tinkerers of the D&D world, and are the great innovators of their people.
                They have the ability to create small trinkets with minimal effort, and often use these trinkets to help them achieve their current goals.

                 Halflings are small folk, standing about 3 feet high on average. Halflings tend to live within small cluster
                groups in little towns. Halflings enjoy the good things in life, good food, a warm fire, and a comfy home surrounded by peaceful neighbors.
                However, some Halflings long for something different, they long for Adventure. The inherent traits Halflings are born with
                become very condusive to a life filled with adventure. Their dimunitve stature makes them adept at going unnoticed, and they seem
                to have a natural luckiness that other humanoids lack. They are naturally brave and are resistant to fearful effects as well.
                There are two types of Halfling, the first is a Lightfoot, the most common variety and the most adept at hiding in plain sight. The 
                second is the Stout Halfling, many believe that Stout halflings are closely related to dwarves. As such they are resistant to 
                poisons and tend to be more hardy than their lightfoot counterparts.

            <p>
                 Half-Orcs, like Half-Elves, have a human parent. Half-Orcs also come from an Orc parent as well.
                The usual aggressiveness and hostility of the Orcs is not always abundant within Half-Orcs thanks to their Human heritage.
                Although, the only real difference between Orcs and the Half-Orcs is that the latter tends to be smaller than the former. 
                Half-Orcs typically live up to about 75 years, reaching to over 6 feet tall. They have Darkvision, and are naturally intimidating.
                Half-Orcs make excellent melee fighters thanks to their two features, Relentless Endurance and Savage Attacks. Relentless Endurance 
                allows the Half-Orc to continue fighting even when their hp drops to 0, and Savage Attacks increases the effectiveness of Critical Hits.

                 Half-Elves are the offspring of a Human and an Elf. Sometimes, Half-Elves feel they do not quite fit in with their 
                Elven kin, and some Half-Elves find more comfort among human cities,
                where due to their Elven ancestry are usually more wise and steady than the rest of the population around them. Because of their dual nature,
                Half-Elves find themselves on one of two sides of a coin. They usually end up as diplomats or as unaccepted wanderers. Thanks to their
                Elven blood, they have Darkvision, and cannot be put to sleep. They also gain additional skills and extra languages. Half-Elves, because of how 
                consistent their stats tend to be could also do well in really any role you want. Half-Elves seem to fall into the 
                "Jack-of-all-trades master of none" category. Where they can do most things well, but dont specialize in anything particular.

                 Tieflings are easily the most mistrusted and mistreated of the humanoids in this list. Tielfings are
                literally devilish by nature. The exact circumstances vary, whether it is the literal offspring of a devil and humanoid, 
                or if the infernal nature comes from some form of deal or contract, the outcome is the same. Such a nature has its perks though.
                As a Tielfing, those characters gain Darkvision, resistance to fire damage, and innate 
                magical abilities. Tieflings are not evil by nature, they vary in their tendencies just as much as humans do.
