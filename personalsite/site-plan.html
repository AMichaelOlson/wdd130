      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Dungeons & Dragons is probably the biggest TTRPG (Table Top Role Playing Game) out there. For those who are new to RPG's, and especially to D&D, it can be daunting to decide what to do and where to start! What do you need to start? How exactly does the game work? If you've wondered something like that before, then wonder no more! As someone who has played the game for many years, I know quite a bit about those questions! This website will have those answers in a convenient location, and might even answer some questions you didn't know you had! </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Classes List</h3>
      <p>
        Now for the fun and exciting part! Learning about what classes are available for you as a player in Dungeons and 
        Dragons! But, what is a class? Well, you will learn that on this page! Go there to find out what a class is, what 
        classes you can choose from, and what each of those classes can do. Along with that information, there will also be 
        recommended character options, caharacter background ideas, and the strengths and weaknesses of choosing that 
        class. The goal is to provide you with all the information you would need when selecting something as important 
        as who your character is in Dungeons and Dragons. A class is a pretty big decision in Character Creation, so it's 
        important that you are properly aware of what your choice will mean. Of course, really any class is fun, and there 
        is no objective class that is better than any other one, but each person who plays Dungeons and Dragons gravitates 
        towards a particular playstyle, and finding yours earlier is better! Of course, now that you know what this page is going 
        to be about, the only thing left for you to do is leave this short synopsis paragraph behind you and go explore all the 
        options that you can find for creating your first of many D&D characters!

      <h3>Character Options</h3>
      <p>
        So you know you want to play Dungeons and Dragons, and you have an idea for what class or profession you want for your 
        character. What's next? Well, the next thing for you is going to be determining what type of character you want to 
        play! This page is all about who you will be, are you a Dwarf? an Elf? maybe youre a Dragonborn! No matter what you 
        think you might choose, all the official character options will be listed here for your choice and for your convenience.
        Each character background option comes with its own perks and drawbacks. Some of them are very common, and the normal 
        everyday folk would noot bat an eye in the typical Dungeons and Dragons game. But some of them are uncommon or even 
        rare, and its important to know what the NPCs or Non Player Characters of the D&D game would think about your character.
        Some of them are monstrous or even dangerous in nature, and before picking that background it would help you to know 
        how to interact with roleplaying encounters you find yourself in. All of these things will be found within the 
        Character Options page here. So with all that said, what is that you're waiting for? Go on and find out which background 
        speaks to you!
