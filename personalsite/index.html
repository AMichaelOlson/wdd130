            What is a TableTop Roleplaying Game(TTRPG)?
        </h2>
        <p>
            A Roleplaying game is a group activity, where you and other people are essentially acting as a different entity
            and describing what they do in response to various scenarios. In Tabletop gaming, specifically in D&D and other systems
            similar to it, there is one person, called a Dungeon Master or DM, who acts as a combination of judge, narrator, 
            and also plays the parts of all other good or bad Non-Player Characters or NPC's. Everyone else who is not the DM plays
            as a Character within the game. Each player has a different skillset and together they form a group of the protaganists.
            In a TTRPG, the DM creates and describes scenarios and the players then say how their character responds to that. This 
            pattern very simply put is what makes up a majority of TTRPGs. Many of them use different dice which adds a randomness
            to the game. So instead of just saying how a player wants their character to break down a door, now they roll a dice and
            they only succeed if a certain number is rolled or higher.

             Why play a TTRPG? It encourages many positive outcomes, such as the freedom to express creativity, a good opportunity 
             for social interaction, a flexible gameplay experience, and immersive sotrytelling. It might seem crazy that these things 
             can come from a group of people rolling dice at a table and describing how a fictitious character they made up responds
             to various narrated scenarios, but many many people have had that exact experience. It can be a little bit weird at first
             especially for those who have little to no experience with roleplaying, and the best advice for how to get into it is to
             just simply give it a try. It's always a little awkward at first, but given time it becomes more normal and more fun 
             for everyone involved. So thats the crash course in what a typical TTRPG would entail, below is what D&D has to offer you.

        What is D&D?
    </h2>
    <p>
        D&D is a TTRPG, and easily one of the most well known and played. Dungeons and Dragons is a Roleplaying game that is set
        primarily in a kind of High Fantasy usually medieval setting, though the setting is completely up to the playgroup.
        In D&D each player controls a protaganist player which has many skills depending on what Background and Class the player
        chose. There are 9 base Character Backgrounds, and 12 Character Classes. That is quite the amount of combinations you can
        create, and when you include all of the extra custom made Classes and Backgrounds it really gets expansive. In this 
        Most TTRPGs use some system of dice, and D&D does as well. What most people consider to be a dice set, consists of
        one 20 sided dice, or d20, one 12 sided dice, or d12, two d10, one d8, one d6, and a d4. Having more than one of each 
        is never a bad idea, especially with the lowest 2 values, but at least one of each is sufficient. 
    </p>
    <p>
        D&D relies on one of two common systems of gameplay. The first is called an Experience Based Milestones, which
        means that in order for characters to grow stronger or level up a certain number of experience must be attained.
        Experience is gained as the story progresses, and as various monsters or challenges are defeated. This is a great
        way to pace most games, and means that players get a reward each time they finish something important. The other
        method for pacing game progression is simply just the Milestone method. This method is one where the DM allows the 
        story to progress to certain specified points until a level up or power increase is provided to the players. This is 
        a useful method to make sure that regardless of the experience point value, the players are at the correct power level
        for any encountered difficulty. Whichever one is used is at the DM's discretion. As challenges become harder, there is 
        the possibilty that fatal mistakes may be made for a character. After all, whats the point of a game with no stakes?
        Don't panic, when a character dies that just means that you or the characters player now needs to create a new one! But,
        as of yet, maybe you don't quite understand how that works? Let's remedy that ASAP then! Go ahead and navigate to the 
        Character Options page and let's get started!
